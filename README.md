Forecasting Heart Failure: An Attempt to Predict Mortality Outcomes for In-Hospital, Heart Failure Patients

Python Heart Disease Project

Heart failure is a serious condition that is commonly believed to only affect adults over 65 years old in a substantial way. However, recent reports suggest that this is not completely the case. Between 2013-2016, ~6.2 million adults aged 20 and above had heart failure (Jackson et al., 2018). This statistic is projected to increase and reflect that ~8.5 million adults will have heart failure, and 29%, almost one-third, of them will be between the ages of 18 and 64 by the year 2030 (Heidenreich et al., 2013). 

If hospitals are not prepared to treat a copious number of patients with heart failure at the same time, there is a likelihood that in-hospital mortality rates will also rise. Therefore, analyzing in-hospital mortalities among heart failure patients could give valuable insight to help prevent overwhelm in healthcare facilities and increase good patient outcomes. A dataset found on Kaggle.com was suitable for studying the relationship between heart failure and in-hospital mortalities. The data itself was queried from MIMIC-III by the original researchers using SQL. They specifically targeted data from patients who had heart failure and were admitted into the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
